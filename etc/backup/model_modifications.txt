This document describes changes made in models so that they will optimize, or sources/ original names of renamed models.

e_coli_core.xml - boundary conditions set to true for metabolites ending with "_b"

Leishmania major iAC560.xml changed lower bounds of reversible reactions to -999999.0, set biological objective of 
biomass reaction (row 162) to 1.0. Original model renamed to iAC560-original.xml.
