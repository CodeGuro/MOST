	<blockquote>Bacteria and other microbes can be used to produce fuels, drugs, and other biochemicals. Naturally they 
	produce small amounts of these products, but they can be genetically engineered to produce larger amounts. Bacteria 
	can live off of sugars, plant matter, or just carbon dioxide and solar energy. Therefore microbes provide an inexpensive 
	way to create these valuable products.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>MOST (Metabolic Optimization and Simulation Tool) is a software package that can be used to create 
	mathematical models of these organisms and run analyses on these models to predict strategies for engineering these 
	microbes to produce desired products in greater abundance. Other software exists that can build models and perform 
	similar analyses, but MOST is easier to use than much of the software that exists today in that it employs Microsoft 
	Excel-like spreadsheet editing functions, as well as functions geared towards the purpose of creating and editing 
	these models. MOST also implements a technique called GDBB that calculates these predictions many times faster 
	than other methods and produces better results. For example, one particular analysis that requires 24 hours using 
	another method is performed by GDBB in 81 seconds! Until now, GDBB was only available in a command line program 
	that requires programming knowledge to use. MOST is the only software package available that implements GDBB in 
	an intuitive user-friendly interface.</blockquote>
